# Cameleon

Hi ! Here his my first project in Java.   
It's a game, and the objective is simple : conquer all the map.  
They are two players : you and the opposite AI player or you and one of your friend (Look at the settings in the main menu!)  
Therefore, two moves are possible :  
 - You can duplicate yourself within a radius of 1 square.
 - Or you can jump within a radius of 2 squares.
Diagonals are allowed.
The one who will have the most case of his colors at the last move win.  

# Run 
Just make sure that you have Java 1.8 or more.
On Linux : <p> <code> git clone https://github.com/cyrilghl/cameleon.git && cd cameleon && java -jar cameleon_jar</code></p>
On Mac and Windows : just execute Cameleon.jar

# One more thing

I erased the music that you can play during your game because they are non-free. So if you got an error, don't hesitate to contact me I'll fix it!
