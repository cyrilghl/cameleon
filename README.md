# Cameleon

Hi ! Here his my first project in Java.   
It's a game, and the objective is simple : conquer all the map.  
They are two players : you and the AI player or you and one of you friend (Look the settings in the main menu!)  
Therefore, two moves are possible :  
 - You can duplicate yourself within a radius of 1 square.
 - Or you can jump within a radius of 2 squares.
Diaogals are allowed.
The one who will have the most case of his colors at the last move win.
